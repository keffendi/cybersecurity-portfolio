### Question 1 – Destination IP Address

**Question:**  
Which IP address was the connection established with?

**Investigation approach:**  
I filtered the SIEM logs to focus on network connection events related to port 5678 on the WIN-105 host. I reviewed the destination fields in the results to identify the IP address associated with the suspicious connection.
